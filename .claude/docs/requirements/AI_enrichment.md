Brief:
This brief is for UX/UI redesign for the AI enrichment tab.

UI scope:
- Page: Settings
- Tab: Pre-AI

UI design Principles:
- modern, minimal UI
- maxmise free space on the page, making it easy for users to identify key information they should be aware of and action buttons they can use

New layout:
The page content and action button should be rearranged into a table.

Columns are:
1. Vendor Data (Amazon Purchases, Amazon Returns, Apple App Store)
2. Identified (Number of  transactions imported from True Layer that are from the vendor and could be matched)
3. Matched (Number of transactions that have been matched)
4. Actions
    - Import
    - View transactions
    - Run matching

Each row will Represent one Vendor Data source:
1. Amazon Purchases
2. Amazon Returns
3. Apple App Store
