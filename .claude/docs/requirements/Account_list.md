Brief:
This brief is for UX/UI redesign for the True Layer Linked Accounts component in the Bank tab in settings. 

UI scope: 
- Page: Settings
- Tab: Bank
- Component: Bank Integration

UI design Principles:
- modern, minimal UI
- maxmise free space on the page, making it easy for users to identify key information they should be aware of and action buttons they can use

New layout:
This should be a table with nested rows of linked accounts, where rows expand to show  further detail as needed. 

Component:
- Title: "Linked Accounts"
- Action Button: "Add Account"

Nested table level 1 columns:
1. Bank (e.g. Santander, Revolut, Monzo)
2. Action (Sync, Disconnect)

Nested Table level 2 columns:
1. Account Name (e.g. Everyday saver)
2. Account type (e.g. Saving, Transaction, Credit Card)
3. Last Sync
4. Action (Sync, Disconnect)
